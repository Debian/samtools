License   :
	
	This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
	The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest. This code was
	written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
	This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.
	
	Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
	This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
	except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
	with every copy.
	
	To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
	MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
	needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
	will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.


Files     :  win32/*
Removed   :  Missing source.
	
	The win32 directory is present in the original upstream sources, but
	was removed from the Debian source package, as it contains binary files for the
	win32 platform without their corresponding source files.
