The original sources of Samtools were modified by removing the win32 directory.
This was done using the git-import-orig program from the git-buildpackage
utilities. This source package is currently migrated from svn-buildpackage to
git-buildpackage, and a get-orig-source target for debian/rules will be added
later.
